# Lakshminarayanan (Srinath) Nandakumar

I am a software engineer specializing in the field of Blockchain. Building things using first principles thinking gives me the most joy and satisfaction. Welcome to my little space where I share and document my interests and projects outside my day job.

## Github

Please have a look at my `pinned` repositories to learn more about my current and past personal projects. From time to time, I engage in solving coding challenges and  get hands-on developing quick engineering prototypes. 

### Other Repos
Here are a few of my unpinned repositories that you might find interesting and helpful:
* [merkle-gaurd](https://github.com/srinathln7/merkle-guard) - A cryptographic prototype to verify the integrity of downloaded files from a grpc server using merkle trees
* [just-dsa](https://github.com/srinathln7/just-dsa) - A collection of engaging data structures and algorithmic challenges, each with a detailed solution explanation.
* [Haskell-for-plutus](https://github.com/srinathln7/Haskell-for-Plutus) - Documenting my venture while learning Haskell to write smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.
